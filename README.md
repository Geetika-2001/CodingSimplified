# CodingSimplified_GK

This repository is aimed at creating a One stop Destination of codes of all Data structures and Algorithms along with basic explaination of lines of codes to make it readable.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://linktodocumentation)

The contributions acceptable can be of the following types:

1.Making code more optimized , while ensuring code readability of a beginner.

2.Adding comments to make lines of code understable.

3.Adding Codes of more data structure and algorithms in the same format as adopted by the maintainer.

4.Improving/Adding basic definitions/time complexities/Stabitilty of the code.

5.Adding link to provide algorithm explaination

6.Adding same codes in C++ and Python , to ensure language flexibility for beginners.
